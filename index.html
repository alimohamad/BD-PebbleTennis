						<h2>Using tech in Innovative ways.</h2>
						<h4>Smartwatches, like Pebbles, Apple Watches, and assorted Android watches are relatively new tech; therefore, there is no set paradigm for how to use them. Strapping a Pebble to a tennis racket may seem a  strange, but we think that this is we've done something great, and we hope you think so too. Smartwatches, Pebbles in particular, are very exciting pieces of tech, and have many applications; we just need to find them.</h4>

						<h3>What is Tennis?</h3>
					
						<p>Tennis is a racquet sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a racquet that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a good return. The opponent who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite opponent will.</p>
