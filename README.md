# BD-PebbleTennis
A Pebble strapped to a Tennis Racket that records your strokes and shares them via SendGrid.

(Ali from the future here - I did not actually work on what was described above, two of my friends did at a HackRU far far in the past. Maybe an hour before demos I wanted to make a site for their project to use some new UX/UI resources I learned about, like colourlovers to have a good set of design guidelines. They may have ended up winning second place at that HackRU and won a ton of prizes of which I got none because I was not technically on their team, but I got something better: incremental improvement in my frontend design abilities. Ha!
...
I was really bitter that they wouldn't tell the HackRU organizers I was on their team. That was the year that the app-controlled BB-8s came out, and they won 2 of them. I'm not sure that I've gotten over it yet.)
